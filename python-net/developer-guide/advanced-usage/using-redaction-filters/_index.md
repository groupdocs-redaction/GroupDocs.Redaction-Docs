GroupDocs.Redaction allows you to set the page-based scope for your redaction of two types:
*   page range, a given number of pages at certain offset from the beginning or the end of the page;
*   page area (on each page), which is a top-left based rectangle.  

All filters inherit from [RedactionFilter](https://reference.groupdocs.com/redaction/net/groupdocs.redaction.redactions/redactionfilter/) and as an array are set to **Filters** property of the [ReplacementOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/redaction/net/groupdocs.redaction.redactions/replacementoptions/).

You can combine these filters in one set in order to set the scope of redaction to an area on a specific page. For more details, see [Use PDF redaction filters]({{< ref "redaction/net/developer-guide/advanced-usage/using-redaction-filters/use-pdf-redaction-filters" >}}) article.
