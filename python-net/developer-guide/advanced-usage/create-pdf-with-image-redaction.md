In some cases you might need to redact the pages of a document as images, redacting entire areas of the page instead or in addition to a specific text. With GroupDocs.Redaction you can use the following approach:  

*   open the document and apply all required redactions to the document's body (text, annotations, etc.);
    
*   save it as a rasterized PDF file (containing images of the original document's pages);
    
*   apply ImageAreaRedaction to remove specific areas on the pages within the PDF document.  
    
The following example demonstrates how to create a rasterized PDF from a Microsoft Word document and apply image redactions to its pages:

**Python**

```python
import groupdocs.redaction as gr
import groupdocs.redaction.options as gro
import groupdocs.redaction.redactions as grr
import groupdocs.redaction.configuration as grc
import groupdocs.pydrawing as grd
from io import BytesIO
import os

def run():

    # Create an in-memory binary stream
    stream = BytesIO()

    # Load the document to be redacted
    with gr.Redactor("source.pdf") as redactor:

        # Save the redacted document
        ro = gro.RasterizationOptions()
        ro.enabled = True
        redactor.save(stream, ro)
        stream.seek(0)

    # Define the position on image
    sample_point = grd.Point(40, 160)
    # Define the size of the area which need to be redacted
    sample_size = grd.Size(350, 75)
    # Define color of redaction
    color = grd.Color.from_argb(255, 220, 20, 60)

    # Specify the redaction options
    repl_opt = grr.RegionReplacementOptions(color, sample_size)
    img_red = grr.ImageAreaRedaction(sample_point, repl_opt)

    # Load the stream to be redacted
    with gr.Redactor(stream) as redactor:

        # Apply the redaction
        result = redactor.apply(img_red)
        
        # Re-open the rasterized PDF document to redact its pages as images
        if (result.status != gr.RedactionStatus.FAILED):
            # Save the document to a custom location and convert its pages to images
            ro = gro.RasterizationOptions()
            ro.enabled = True
            with open("output.pdf", "wb") as stream_out:
                redactor.save(stream_out, ro)
```

Please, note that you don't have to use GroupDocs.Redaction to create a rasterized PDF from an office document. You will be able to use it, if you don't have any other tool for that.
