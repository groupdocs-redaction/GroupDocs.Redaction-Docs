This method can be used when for some reason files have non-standard extensions or if its format is supported, but not pre-configured. For instance, all kinds of plain text files (batch, command files, etc.) could be opened. In this case you do not need to create your own format handler. As it is shown below, you can add file extension (e.g. ".dump") as being handled by the same *[DocumentFormatInstance](https://reference.groupdocs.com/python-net/redaction/groupdocs.redaction.integration/documentformatinstance)* as all plain text files:

**Python**

```python
import groupdocs.redaction as gr
import groupdocs.redaction.options as gro
import groupdocs.redaction.redactions as grr
import groupdocs.redaction.configuration as grc

def run():

    # Add .dump format to the list of supported formats
    config = grc.RedactorConfiguration.get_instance()

    settings = config.find_format(".txt")

    settings.extension_filter = settings.extension_filter + ",.dump";

    # Specify the redaction options
    repl_opt = grr.ReplacementOptions("[redacted]")
    ex_red = grr.ExactPhraseRedaction("dolor", repl_opt)

    # Load the document to be redacted
    with gr.Redactor("source.dump") as redactor:

        # Apply the redaction
        result = redactor.apply(ex_red)
        
        # Save the redacted document
        redactor.save()
```

In detail, creating your own document format instances is covered in another article.
