Although GroupDocs.Redaction itself does not contain OCR as a part of its distributable, it allows you to integrate any paid or free OCR solution. 
You have to implement [IOcrConnector](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/redaction/java/com.groupdocs.redaction.integration/IOcrConnector) interface and its recognize() method, taking a stream with an image as an argument and returning a structured representation of the text, including bounding rectangles. 

**Java**

```java
public class MyOwnOcrConnector implements IOcrConnector
{
    public MyOwnOcrConnector()
    {
    }

    public RecognizedImage recognize(InputStream imageStream)
    {
	// TODO Create an instance of RecognizedImage class using OCR result returned by your OCR toolkit
    }
}

```

Once the instance is passed to [RedactorSettings](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/redaction/java/com.groupdocs.redaction.options/RedactorSettings) constructor, GroupDocs.Redaction will use it for image files and embedded images during an ordinary textual redaction process.

**Java**

```java
try (Redactor redactor = new Redactor("\\Sample.docx", new LoadOptions(), new RedactorSettings(new MyOwnOcrConnector())))
{
    // Assign an instance before using Redactor
    redactor.apply(new ExactPhraseRedaction("John Doe", new ReplacementOptions(java.awt.Color.BLACK)));
    redactor.save();
}

```

GroupDocs.Redaction provides two examples of the IOcrConnector implementation, free to use and customize for your needs. First, the [implementation based on Aspose.OCR for Cloud SDK]({{< ref "/redaction/java/developer-guide/advanced-usage/using-ocr/use-aspose-ocr-for-cloud" >}}). Second [implementation is using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services API]({{< ref "/redaction/java/developer-guide/advanced-usage/using-ocr/use-microsoft-azure-computer-vision" >}}). Both services propose a trial subscription plan, but you can use any other free or paid OCR solution, web-based or on premise, by creating your own implementation of [IOcrConnector](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/redaction/java/com.groupdocs.redaction.integration/IOcrConnector).
