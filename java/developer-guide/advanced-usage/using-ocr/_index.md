GroupDocs.Redaction supports both types of image documents for Optical Character Recognition (OCR):
*   image files, such as printed document scans (PNG, JPG, etc.)
*   embedded images within office documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.)  

You have to implement [IOcrConnector](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/redaction/java/com.groupdocs.redaction.integration/IOcrConnector) interface and pass the instance to [RedactorSettings](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/redaction/java/com.groupdocs.redaction.options/RedactorSettings) constructor.

For more details, see [OCR Usage Basics]({{< ref "redaction/java/developer-guide/advanced-usage/using-ocr/ocr-usage-basics" >}}) article.

## OCR usage limitations

There are the following limitations of the OCR with GroupDocs.Redaction for Java v21.6:
*   textual replacements are not supported, so you have to use color box replacements to redact text in images.
*   Spreadsheets, HTML and Markdown document types are not supported.  

We are working on removing these limitations in future releases of GroupDocs.Redaction.
