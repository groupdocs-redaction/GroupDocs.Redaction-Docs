In some cases, you might need to pre-rasterize the document before opening it and applying redactions. 

For instance, you might need to use an [ImageAreaRedaction](https://reference.groupdocs.com/redaction/net/groupdocs.redaction.redactions/imagearearedaction/) for a whole page of a document with searchable text and images. In order to do that, you will need to pass the Boolean flag to the [LoadOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/redaction/net/groupdocs.redaction.options/loadoptions/) class constructor.

The following example demonstrates how to pre-rasterize a Microsoft Word document:

**C#**

```csharp
bool preRasterize = true;
using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor(@"sample.docx"), new LoadOptions(preRasterize))
{
    // Make changes to the file as a rasterized PDF, e.g. uisng ImageAreaRedaction:
    System.Drawing.Point samplePoint = new System.Drawing.Point(516, 311);
    System.Drawing.Size sampleSize = new System.Drawing.Size(170, 35);
    RedactorChangeLog result = redactor.Apply(new ImageAreaRedaction(samplePoint,
                    new RegionReplacementOptions(System.Drawing.Color.Blue, sampleSize)));
    if (result.Status != RedactionStatus.Failed)
    {
        redactor.Save();
    };
}
```
